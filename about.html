<h4>Hello,</h4>



<p>
I am a multidisciplinary creative developer based in Yaoundé, Cameroon,
with a strong foundation in web design, technical troubleshooting, and digital media production.
My work bridges the gap between functionality and aesthetics,
combining deep technical knowledge—ranging from 3d animations and driver integration to responsive
UI design—with a refined sense of visual composition and user experience.
With a background in configuring gaming hardware, optimizing emulation platforms, and crafting intuitive web interfaces using CSS and Gsap. 
</p>

<p>
I bring precision and adaptability to every project. His portfolio reflects a commitment to problem-solving, iterative learning,
 and creative experimentation across domains including image editing, 
baking science, and digital privacy workflows.
</p>

<p>
Driven by a long-term vision of freelancing independence and global collaboration,
i am currently focused on building immersive web experiences and 
showcasing my technical versatility through a curated portfolio.
